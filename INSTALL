to install to this scikit-learn just use pip but make sure you have a modern gcc available and have activated the appropriate
conda environment. e.g.

module load gcc
conda activate haxby_env39
pip install git+https://github.com/bogpetre/scikit-learn

If you already have the systemwide package try 
conda remove --force scikit-learn
To get rid of it without removing packages that depend on it, then install this scikit-learn version in this folder
